   | For improved performance, services can concurrently process inbound
   | APXML messages (from both APClient and AlarmPoint).  Messages are grouped
   | in two stages: first, by priority and second, by process group.
   | Messages  within the same group are processed sequentially in a
   | first-come-first-served order, while messages in different groups are
   | processed concurrently.
   |
   | NOTE: The two stage grouping means that normal and high priority messages
   | are always processed concurrently, regardless of whether they are in
   | the same process group.
   |
   | NOTE: A message's priority is specified by the apia_priority token, whose
   | value is either "normal" or "high".  A message without such a token
   | defaults to "normal" priority.
   |
   | NOTE: A message's process group is specified by the apia_process_group
   | token, whose value is an application-defined string.  Message's without
   | such a token are grouped together.
   |
   | NOTE: Thread counts must be positive integers.

   | The Integration Service scripts and implementation POJOs have access to

   | and enhance security, an Integration Service should load its own classes
   | and resources from an unshared directory.  The classpath element allows
   | an Integration Service to specify multiple paths that will be added to
   | the service's classpath during the processing of an Integration Service
   | Request.

   | available  to all services), the augmented classpath is exclusive to
